I don't sleep like I used to
Counting sheep doesn't bring you back to bed
With seven drinks in the green room
We don't speak and I forget words you said


Take me back in time
Your chest pressed up on mine
The stage is ours tonight
Maybe it's time we make it right
Maybe this time we'll make it right

But maybe we're lonely
Pretending it's love
'Cause I'm not the old me
And our time is up
We both know we thought about
Tonight for so long
But maybe we're lonely
Pretending it's love
Pretending it's
Pretending it's
(Pretending it's love)
(Pretending it's love)


I don't sleep like I used to
You're in my sheets but I don't know
Where you've gone
Seven weeks since I knew you
We don't speak but we sing the same old song

Take me back in time
Your chest pressed up on mine
And I know that we're sold on a feeling
But maybe it's time we make it right
Maybe this time we'll make it right


But maybe we're lonely
Pretending it's love
'Cause I'm not the old me
And our time is up
We both know we thought about
Tonight for so long
But maybe we're lonely
Pretending it's love
Pretending it's
(It's love)
Pretending it's
(It's love)
Pretending it's love
Pretending it's love
It's love, it's love
Pretending it's love
Baby this time we'll make it right
